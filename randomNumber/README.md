Problem Statement:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1.Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication:
The goal of this program is to generate a random number after a delay of 3 seconds, and store the delay in a
variable so can be modified. The program displays a message every second indicating the time remaining
until the random number is generated and then outputs the generated number.
=======
1. Reverse String.
The problem is to create a program that uses the setTimeout() function to reverse a given string after a delay
of 2 seconds. The program should use a variable “input” storing a string as input and then implement a delay of
2 seconds before reversing the string. The reversed string should then be printed as output.
